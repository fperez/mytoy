# MyToy: a minimal Python package

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fperez/mytoy/HEAD?urlpath=lab)

This repository contains a minimal, toy Python package with a few files as illustration for students of how to lay out their code to meet minimal Python packaging requirements.

It has a single source directory (`mytoy`) with an `__init__.py` file and one "implementation" file (`toys.py`) as well as a few tests in `mytoy/tests`.

In addition to this `README.md` it includes some basic infrastructure: `LICENSE`, `pyproject.toml` and `.gitignore` files, as well as a `binder` folder that contains the necessary files for the above Binder link to work.

The only docs included are this `README.md` file - a larger package would have a proper docs directory and associated Sphinx/JupyterBook build.

This is more or less the absolute minimum for a "real" python package that can be installed from source, tested and experimented with on Binder.  For a more "official" version of this same idea, see the [PyPA sample project repo](https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject), documented in detail in the [Packaging Tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects). The [Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org) contains comprehensive documentation on this topic.
